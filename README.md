# tetris

## Aim
Our small project is supposed to imitate a popular 80's game Tetris. We were inspired by the original version with the 10x20 board and basic tetromino mechanics. We created our own graphics though.

## How do I run the program?
There is no installer attached to our project, in order to play the game you just need to enter ultimateklocek->Debug->ultimateklocek.exe 

##What are the requirements?
The only requirement is a Windows operation system

##Hope you enjoy your gameplay experience :))
